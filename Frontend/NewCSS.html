Having a well-planned grocery list gets you in and out of the store quickly and helps you stick to your healthy eating plan.

Use these tips and in just a few minutes, you'll have a blueprint for a cart full of groceries that won't bust your budget or diet.

Organize your grocery shopping list by aisle. Follow these tips for filling that list with the healthiest foods from each aisle.

1. Bakery and Bread
On Your List:

Whole wheat bread, pita pockets, and English muffins
Whole-grain flour tortillas
Look for the words "whole wheat" or "whole wheat flour" as the first ingredient on the label.

Choose whole-grain breads that contain at least 3 to 4 grams of fiber and have fewer than 100 calories per slice.

2. Meat and Seafood
On Your List:

Skinless chicken or turkey breasts
Ground turkey or chicken
Salmon, halibut, trout, mackerel, or your favorite seafood
Reduced-sodium lunchmeat (turkey, roast beef)
If you buy red meat, choose the leanest cuts -- ones with very little marbling.

Eat ground chicken or ground turkey breast instead of ground beef. These are much lower in fat. Get creative with the condiments and youâ€™ll get flavor without the fat.
